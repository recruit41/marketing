## Before Your Interview

### Use Google Chrome Browser
- Our platform exclusively supports the official Google Chrome browser.

!!! warning "Unsupported Browsers"
    Please avoid using Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Brave, Arc), Safari, Microsoft Edge, or any mobile browsers.

### Check your Camera and Microphone
- **Working Equipment**: Ensure your camera and microphone are functioning correctly. Bluetooth headphones/earphones are recommended if available.

- **Test Your Setup**: Critically, test your camera and microphone at [webcammictest.com](https://webcammictest.com) well before your interview.

### Prepare for Screen Sharing
- During the interview, you might be asked to share your screen.

    You must share your entire screen (not just a tab or window). This is crucial for us to evaluate any code you write. Without full screen sharing, we cannot grade your code.

### Familiarize Yourself with Our Platform
- Practice with a mock interview at [https://demo.recruit41.com/](https://demo.recruit41.com/). This will help you get comfortable with audio/video controls, screen sharing, and other platform features.

### Suitable Interview Environment
- **Quiet & Distraction-Free**: Choose a location where you won't be interrupted.
- **Good Lighting**: Sit facing a light source so your face is clearly visible.
- **Minimize Background Noise**: Ensure a quiet setting for clear audio.
